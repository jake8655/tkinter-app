# Tkinter-App
Random tkinter school project
## A lot better Idea
- Impossible game
- map = maze
- player = circle (smiley face)
- have to move around maze 
- some mazes impossible, have to use "bug"
- "bug" = when player on edge of screen it gets stuck and u can spawn it at any other position at the edge of the screen

## OLD Idea
- Collecting trash
- Move with mouse (or arrow keys if cant with mouse cuz of tkinter)
- Click on trash with "trash collecting stick" to pick up and click on trash bin/bag to drop off
- Each trash collected is +1 point
- Trash spawns from the top (maybe ocean brings it) and stops at shore
- Whole scene is on the shore
## OLD Issue
- Still don't know how to move to exact coords
