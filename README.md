# Tkinter-App
Random tkinter school project
## Idea
- Collecting trash
- Move with mouse (or arrow keys if cant with mouse cuz of tkinter)
- Click on trash with "trash collecting stick" to pick up and click on trash bin/bag to drop off
- Each trash collected is +1 point
- Trash spawns from the top (maybe ocean brings it) and stops at shore
- Whole scene is on the shore
## Issue
- Still don't know how to move to exact coords
